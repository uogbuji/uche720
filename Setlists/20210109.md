# Setlist: B-Boys B-GrownFolks+ (Saturday night), 9 January 2020

A couple of months into my journey re-learning DJing and live-streaming, this was perhaps the first set where I really felt the overall flow, helped by the energy of a large virtual audience (My comments were in response to their text chat). It was entirely un-prepared/freestyle, a mix of the old school and new: hip-hop, soul, funk, and the occasional Afropop.
